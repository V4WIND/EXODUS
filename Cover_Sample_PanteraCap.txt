After a very meaningful self introspection with my mentors help, I have now put all my guts into working with high-octane teams on several challenging and game changing ideas, blockchain for one :)

I am very much excited for the path I have chosen, sincerely believe that committing to a broader foal always helps me focus on the significance of my part and contributions, which would eventually drive me into a better version iteratively.

It would be the very best time of my career to get to prove my calibre using all the learnings harnessed across a few of my collaborations with academicians of the product innovation & operation research world in past 4 years.

I certainly feel much confident that I could reach out to the demanding situations as I have had a first hand insight into the perception of start-up & venture investment firms as a fresh graduate taking all the risk I can.

Hope the team finds the frequencies to be on the same band and look forward for discussing more on how best it would turn out to be having me work for you guys!
